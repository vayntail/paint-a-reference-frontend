# Paint-A-Reference !
Paint-A-Reference is a website for artists to post frames or photo references to share with other artists, who then can create art studies of those frames and share it. Overrall the goal is to encourage sharing of references and to motivate each other by being able to post studies and having a "study hub" of your favorite references and studies.

# Project Status
This project is currently in development. Users can sign-up, log-in, and upload references, however features are limited when it comes to posting studies, commenting, favoriting, deleting, etc.

# Reflection
This was my capstone project for Per Scholas Software Engineering program, demonstrating the full MERN stack. Project goals included demonstrating all I've learned to create a full-stack application from scratch with full CRUD functionalities. The technologies I used includes React and Javascript for front-end, and MongoDB and Node.js for back-end.

This was a challenge since it is the very first full-stack application I've built where the frontend and backend are connected and works together. Further, authorization was a relatively new concept I had some trouble with. Although a challenge, I believe it gave me a lot of knowledge and experience in actually understanding what full-stack looks like, and how they are connected together and how to manage through a project and an idea.

I set out to build a social media-like application for artists because it's something I've always wanted to try to do, to help artists to find others or communities for growth and improvement rather than studying alone. There are a lot of features missing still--however I believe I've learned so much from this overrall experience and the course, of which I plan to carry onto my next project.

An unexpected obstacle I faced was in handling images. I knew I had to find a hosting service to be able to save the images' links for display, and I had planned to use imgur. However I encountered a few issues when attempting to use imgur, therefore found another service called (imgbb)[https://imgbb.com/] which worked perfectly. My only concern for the future is privacy, and would like to find ways to use my own image hosting or another secure cloud way to host images for my own website, rather than using a third party that can be accessed anywhere.

Something I learned especially coming to planning, time management or the development process overrall was to set up a daily to-do in priority. Having ADHD, I believe if I had set out a small task list of things to do each day beforehand with what is priority then it would have went smoother, so I don't have to think each day "what is next to do?" and I can just follow what is already set.
